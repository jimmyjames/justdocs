## Table of contents

By default, a sticky Table of Contents will be rendered on the right of the page.
It will be updated with the currently active menu as the reader scrolls.

It can be disabled on a page by specifying `notoc: true` in the frontmatter.

Only the top-level section headers will be shown in the Table of Contents, and it will be hidden entirely on smaller screen sizes.
